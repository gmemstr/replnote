# REPLNote

Write your notes with a built in REPL!

## Installation

Download from GitHub releases, or build it yourself using `leiningen`.

## Usage

The editor works much like a normal text editor, but exposes a Clojure
REPL. You can evaluate expressions by adding a `#` preceeding a Clojure
expression wrapped in parenthesis. Expressions are evaluated when the
ENTER key is pressed.

```text
This is some example text.
Blah blah #(str "This will be evaluated!")
```

You can run the application by either double clicking the jar file or
running the following command:

    $ java -jar replnote-X.Y.Z-standalone.jar
